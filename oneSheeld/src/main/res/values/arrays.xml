    <!-- List of Display states to be shown in the UI.  The @string references must be strings (they cannot be references to strings).  This array must be exactly two elements and the references cannot be changed, without making a code change to EditActivity. The primary purpose of making this array a resource is to allow reordering the elements for different localizations. -->
